Telecom customer churn analysis
## Overview

This project is a customer churn analysis for **Vertex Mobile Net.**, a telecom company facing revenue reduction due to customer attrition. The analysis is performed using **Power BI** to identify key drivers of churn and provide actionable recommendations for customer retention.

## Business Problem

Vertex Mobile Net. is experiencing a reduction in revenue due to increasing customer churn. The company needs to understand **why customers are churning** and **how to reduce attrition** to improve customer retention and stabilize revenue. This project aims to analyze customer data to identify churn drivers and recommend data-driven strategies.

## Dashboard Summary

The Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive view of customer churn at Vertex Mobile Net. Key metrics and insights visualized in the dashboard include:

*   **Overall Churn Rate:**  **26.9%**, representing **1796 churned customers** out of **6687**.
*   **Churn by Demographics:** Analysis by **gender** and **age groups** highlights segments with higher churn propensity. Notably, the **30-65 age group** shows the highest churn.
*   **Churn Reasons:** Top reasons for churn include **competitor offers**, **price sensitivity**, and **service dissatisfaction**.
*   **Contract Type Impact:** **Month-to-month contracts** are strongly correlated with higher churn rates compared to longer-term contracts (One-Year and Two-Year).
*   **Unlimited Data Plan Influence:** Customers **without unlimited data plans** are significantly more likely to churn.
*   **Geographic Churn:**  Significant state-level variation in churn, with **California (CA)** exhibiting an exceptionally high churn rate.
*   **Group Contracts:**  Initial analysis suggests potential for group contracts in reducing churn, but further investigation is needed.

**Key Insights**
